<p><em>Optional. Defaults to <code>latest</code>.</em> The version of the resource to
fetch.</p><p>If set to <code>latest</code>, scheduling will just find the latest available
version of a resource and use it, allowing versions to be skipped.  This is
usually what you want, e.g. if someone pushes 100 git commits.</p><p>If set to <code>every</code>, builds will walk through all available versions of
the resource. Note that if <code>passed</code> is also configured, it will only
step through the versions satisfying the constraints.</p><p>If set to a specific version (e.g. <code>{ref: abcdef123}</code>), only that
version will be used. Note that the version must be available and detected by
the resource, otherwise the input will never be satisfied. You may want to
use <a href="fly-check-resource.html"><code>check-resource</code></a> to force detection of resource versions,
if you need to use an older one that was never detected (as all newly
configured resources start from the latest version).</p>
